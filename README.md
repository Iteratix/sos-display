### Development / Production Rotation Toggle

The toggle rotates the `<canvas>` 90-degrees for correct display when used in production with the LED wall.  

When programming with coordinates, assume that 0,0 on X,Y axis are at top left corner of a 192x320 rectangle.  X/Y does not change when the rotation is applied (it is now at bottom left corner with X going up vertically, and Y going horizionally).  But rather than concern yourself with rotation nuances, just don't worry about production mode.  If you code for dev, it'll work in prod orientation.
